## **Music Clustering Project** ðŸŽ¶
### **A Machine Learning Prject** ðŸ¤–

This project demonstrates how to group music based on its characteristics using K-Means Clustering, an **unsupervised machine learning algorithm**. It helps identify patterns within the data and can be useful for organizing playlists, making music recommendations, and analyzing trends.

### **Conclusion** ðŸ”¥

- We used the K-Means Clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning model, to identify patterns and group information within the dataset.
- We defined 3 clusters using the Elbow Method.
- We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- We identified the top 5 genres by cluster and visualized them using bar and heatmap graphs.
